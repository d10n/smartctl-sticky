# smartctl-sticky

Telegraf was spamming up Linux audit logs in the systemd journal and dmesg due to its usage of sudo.

This tool safely wraps smartctl, letting users in the smartctl group run smartctl as root with whitelisted command-line arguments, without spamming the audit log and without the need for sudo.
